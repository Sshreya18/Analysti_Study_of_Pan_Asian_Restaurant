- **Data Analysis:** Utilized **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- **Visualization:** Created insightful charts using **Power BI & Matplotlib**.  
- **Business Insights:** Applied financial modeling techniques to optimize profit margins.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI, Excel  
- **Database & Analysis:** SQL, Google Sheets  
- **Statistical Methods:** Time-Series Analysis, Correlation Studies  

## 📌 Key Findings  
🔹 **Peak Sales Days:** Sunday & Monday generate 60% of weekly revenue.
